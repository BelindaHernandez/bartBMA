Description: BART-BMA Baryesian Additive Regression Trees using Bayesian Model Averaging is an extension to the original BART \dQuote{sum-of-trees} model of Chipman et al. BART-BMA differs to the original BART model in two main aspects in order to implement a greedy model which 
  will be computationally feasible for high dimensional data. Firstly BART-BMA uses a greedy search for the best split points and variables when growing decision trees within each \dQuote{sum-of-trees} 
  model. This means trees are only grown based on the most predictive set of split rules. Also rather than using MCMC, BART-BMA uses a greedy implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging called Occam's Window 
  which take a weighted average over multiple \dQuote{sum-of-trees} models to form its overall prediction. This means that only the set of \dQuote{sum-of-trees} for which there is high support from the data
  are saved to memory and used in the final model.
