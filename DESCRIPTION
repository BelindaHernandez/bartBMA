Description: BART-BMA Bayesian Additive Regression Trees using Bayesian Model Averaging \insertCite{hernandez2018bayesian}{bartBMA} is an extension to the original BART sum-of-trees model \insertCite{chipman2010bart}{bartBMA}. BART-BMA differs to the original BART model in two main aspects in order to implement a greedy model which 
  will be computationally feasible for high dimensional data. Firstly BART-BMA uses a greedy search for the best split points and variables when growing decision trees within each sum-of-trees 
  model. This means trees are only grown based on the most predictive set of split rules. Also rather than using MCMC, BART-BMA uses a greedy implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging called Occam's Window 
  which take a weighted average over multiple sum-of-trees models to form its overall prediction. This means that only the set of sum-of-trees for which there is high support from the data
  are saved to memory and used in the final model.
