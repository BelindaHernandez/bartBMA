\title{Variable inclusion probabilities as defined by Linero (2018)}
\usage{
varIncProb(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A bartBMA object obtained using the barBMA function.}
}
\value{
A vector of posterior inclusion probabilities. The variables are ordered in the same order that they occur in columns of the input covariate matrix used to obtain the input bartBMA object.
}
\description{
This measure defines the posterior inclusion probability of a variable as the model-probability weighted sum of indicator variables for whether the variable was used in any splitting rules in any of the trees in the sum-of-tree model.
